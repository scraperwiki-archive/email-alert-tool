Email Alert Tool
================

The *Email Alert Tool* alerts a user by email when the number of rows in a selected table changes. The table to be 
watched and the email address to be alerted are both configurable.

Testing
-------

The *create-test-db.py* script creates a new database and adds 100 rows of test data to the swdata table. This is for testing that your environment works.
